ShipMove
------------------------
With the object having a rigidbody, I used the horizontal and vertical input instead of manually typing the code for the WASD. This 
was done because it was more time efficient and looked neater in code. The horizontal and vertical input were multiplied with the 
float speed relative to the objects XYZ coordinates.
